# clox-from-crafting-interpreters
An implementation of the Lox programming language from the book "Crafting Interpreters" by Robert Nystrom. 
This code covers the second half of the book, in which a bytecode interpreter and virtual machine are covered.

Why do I study compilers and interpreters as a database engine developer? It is because a lot of the skills are transferrable to the database world, and they help me understand the query processing components of the databases I currently work with.
